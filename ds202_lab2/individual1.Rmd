## Question Set
#1.

boxplot(choco$Rating, main = "Boxplot of Rating from Choco Datatset", xlab = "Rating")
hist(choco$Rating, main = "Histogram of Rating from Choco Datatset", xlab = "Rating")


#From the histogram, you can see that the data are slightly left skewed. The boxplot shows that the ratings are centered near 3.25 and there are outliers at ratings of 2 and below, and at rating of 5.


#2.
plot(choco$Rating, choco$Cocoa.Pct, xlab = "Rating", ylab = "Cocoa %", main = "Rating vs. Cocoa Percent for Chocolate Bars")

#From the plot above, there does not appear to be a relationship between Cocoa percent and rating.


#3.
class(choco$Company.Location)
#Company location is a factor variable. This means that instead of being characterized by letters and numbers, the variables are assigned number codes to represent them.
